    <h2>Drop 001 – 5 Timeless Pieces</h2>
    <p>This week’s drop is all about investment fashion — pieces that don’t just last, but actually get better with age. I own each item I’ve picked below, and these are designed to outlive trends, resist wear, and hold their place in your wardrobe for life. Buy once, wear forever.</p>

    <h3>Pick of the Week: Studio Nicholson Bric T‑shirt</h3>
    <p>Crafted from 100% fluid cotton jersey, the Bric T‑shirt is cut to a regular fit with a ribbed crew neck for a clean silhouette. The fabric feels comfortably soft yet retains its shape, making it as suited to warm‑weather streetwear as it is to layering under knits and jackets. Subtle design details — such as a streamlined boxy shoulder and a cropped length with a heavyweight hem — add refinement without straying into oversized territory. Finished with a screen‑printed logo at the nape, this versatile staple deserves a place in any core wardrobe.</p>

    <h3>Pick #2: Marni Tropical Wool Trousers</h3>
    <p>These trousers are crafted from tropical virgin wool with a cotton/poly amide half‑lining, making them remarkably lightweight and comfortable. Their construction features a loose mid‑rise silhouette with front pleats, a horn button closure, and an elasticated drawstring waist with belt loops. This design allows them to transition easily between casual and dressier settings. The breathable wool fabric remains cool in summer yet insulating in colder months, while the grey colorway offers odour‑ and wrinkle‑resistant versatility. If you prefer a tailored fit, consider sizing down. For anyone looking to own just one pair of grey trousers, these strike a balance between comfort, style and durability.</p>
